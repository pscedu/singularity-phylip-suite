Singularity recipe for [phylip-suite](https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html).

## Building the container for Bridges (or similar)
There is no need to build a container, because an image is already available from the Galaxy project, hence all you need to do is run

```
bash ./pull.sh
```

however, it is recommended that you build it using

```
bash ./rbuild.sh
```

## Installing the container on Bridges (or similar)
Copy the

* `SIF` file
* and all the files generated by `generate_binaries.sh`

to `/opt/packages/phylip-suite/3.967`.

Copy the file `modulefile.lua` to `/opt/modulefiles/phylip-suite` as `3.967.lua`.

## Examples
If there are any examples associated with this package, i.e. an `examples` folder exists in this repository, copy those files to `/opt/packages/examples`.

## Tests
If there any tests associated with this package, then run the command

```
bash ./test.sh
```

## Manpages
If there are manpages available for this package, then copy the man folder to `/opt/packages/phylip-suite/3.967`. The manpages folder will be prepended to `$MANPATH` in `modulefile.lua`.
